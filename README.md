# WordFrequencyFiles

•	Created by John Gaff, last modified on Oct 09, 2019

Create a program that displays how many times a word appears up in a file, or across files.  The program will be seeded with an input file where each line is another file’s relative path.  Each file in the path will contain the words needed to be tracked. User should be able to run the program and see a list of all the words and their respective counts. The program will need to quickly handle 1000’s lines in the input file and display results in a timely manner.

Requirements for the program:  
o    User must be able to interact with it.  
o    The program/executable must be standalone.  
o    A set of easy to follow instructions on how to run and execute the program must be provided. Assume the system used for running the program has just a base OS installed.  
o    To be submitted:  
·	All of the source code and the corresponding executable. Sharing via cloud is acceptable.  
·	Unit tests for your application.  
·	Input data used to test your program.  
 
## For bonus points:  
User should be able to select a word (from the list of words) and display which files the word came from, display how many times the word showed up in each file and display how many times the word showed up in total.
